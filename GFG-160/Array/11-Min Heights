#Question:
Given an array arr[] denoting heights of n towers and a positive integer k.

For each tower, you must perform exactly one of the following operations exactly once.

Increase the height of the tower by k
Decrease the height of the tower by k
Find out the minimum possible difference between the height of the shortest and tallest towers after you have modified each tower.


class Solution:
    def getMinDiff(self, arr,k):
        n=len(arr)
        arr.sort()
        
        res=arr[n-1]-arr[0]
        
        for i in range(n):
            if arr[i]-k<0:
                continue
            minH=min(arr[0]+k,arr[i]-k)
            maxH=max(arr[i-1]+k,arr[n-1]-k)
            
            res=min(res,maxH-minH)
        return res
