        n=len(arr)
        m=n//3
        count={}
        for ele in arr:
            if ele in count:
                count[ele]+=1
            else:
                count[ele]=1
        res=[]
        for key in count:
            if count[key]>m:
                res.append(key)
        res.sort()
        return res
